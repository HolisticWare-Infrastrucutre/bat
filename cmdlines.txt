; For cmdlines.txt, it should be placed in the \$OEM$ 
; folder, and does not need to be specified anywhere 
; else to state its existence. Windows Setup automatically 
; scans for a cmdlines.txt file. All batch files launched by 
; cmdlines.txt should be put into the same folder. 

; The file ALWAYS starts with the line: [COMMANDS]

;Now comes the portion that is parsed to be executed. 
;Each following line MUST be enclosed in quotation marks ( " ).

; CMDLINES.TXT is a VERY limited commandline interface. 
; This means that MOST traditional DOS commands are not available, 
; however external commands (REGEDIT32.EXE , REG.EXE, etc. ) 
; are available.

; If the program to be executed is in the PATH variable 
; (open a command prompt and type ECHO %PATH%) then you do not 
; have to include the full path, the same is true if it is 
; also in the current directory.

; The current directory when CMDLINES.TXT is executed is $OEM$.

; This means that if batch.cmd is in the $OEM$ directory, then 
; you just have simply type batch.cmd. If however, batch.cmd was 
; located in another directory, you will have to include the 
; full path. To help facilitate this, read the comments below.

; If the file/program you wish to execute is in a folder within 
; $OEM$, and the path to the folder is $OEM$/Folder/batch.cmd , 
; then type
; "./Folder/batch.cmd"
; the ./ is a reference to the current directory, so in execution 
; the line will actually become %CDROM%/$OEM$/Folder/batch.cmd 
; If the file/program is located in a folder in the root of the CD, 
; say %CDROM%/Unattend/batch.cmd, then use 
; "../Unattend/batch.cmd"
; The ../ tells the interpreter to get the path to the parent 
; directory of the current directory, so it will become
; %CDROM%/Unattend/batch.cmd
; If you have normal batch commands to execute 
; (PAUSE, TITLE, START, etc.) then it'd be simpler to just create
; the CMD file, and then have CMDLINES.TXT call it. Refer to the above 
; on how to add an entry to CMDLINES.TXT.
