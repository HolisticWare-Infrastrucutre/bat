LD_LIBRARY_PATH

CentOS 

cleanest way to add a library to the search path is by adding a file to 
/etc/ld.so.conf.d/. If you really need to define the variable for all 
users then adding script[s] 
in /etc/profile.d/ should work.

user's .bash_profile file?

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/this/is/my/path

add it in /etc/bashrc, say, at the end.

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib

edit /etc/ld.so.conf and /usr/local/lib or create 
/etc/ld.so.conf/usrlocal.conf and put 
only the line

/usr/local/lib
Then run ldconfig -v as root, and you're done.


Ubuntu

Create a new file /etc/ld.so.conf containing:

	# Begin /etc/ld.so.conf
	/lib
	/usr/lib
	/usr/X11R6/lib
	# whatever else #


Update the dynamic loader cache by running:

ldconfig

In addition to .bashrc, also set the environment variable in .profile. This file will 
get processed and loaded by your session, so it should affect everything running as 
your user. Also: This file says it is not read by Bash if .bashrc exists, but it seems 
to apply still (perhaps since Bash inherits the X session from where it was started). 
It doesn't hurt to have the variable in both files, though.

set it in /etc/bash.bashrc near the top to make a system wide change on bootup.
