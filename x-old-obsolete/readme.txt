The FP-DEF.ZIP archive contains SIGN.DEF and SIGN2.DEF updates for F-Prot for
DOS and F-Prot engine used in F-Secure Anti-Virus.

Note that these SIGN.DEF and SIGN2.DEF updates are not compatible with FSAV
4.02 and earlier versions of the product. If you have FSAV 4.03 (or above) or
F-Prot for DOS 3.xx you can update your installation with these DEF files
without any problem.

To install the updates please unpack the ZIP archive using WinZip or
PkunZIP.EXE to the directory where F-Secure Anti-Virus (or F-Prot for DOS) is
installed (typically C:\Program Files\Data Fellows\F-Secure\Anti-Virus\). Then
it is recommended to restart FSAV for the changes to take effect.
